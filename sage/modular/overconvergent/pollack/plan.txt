Stage 1: Get all existing tests to pass in the following files (some
have no tests right now):

dist.py
distributions.py
fund_domain.py
modsym.py
modsym_dist.py
modsym_symk.py
pLfunction.py
symk.py

Stage 2: Come up with the simplest *design* for this functionality that
could possibly go into Sage and do the same thing as the above.

Stage 3: Implement:

  - one group: write test suite (doctest/docstrings) using the new 
    function names/classes/etc.  Use the program above to generate
    the expected output

  - another group: "quick" implementation in Python of
    parents/elements/etc.  Will copy over a lot of code from above (or
    just refactor things, etc.)

  - make sure it *works*.

Stage 4: Optimization

  - depends on results of stage 3.  Fast dist code is relevant.
