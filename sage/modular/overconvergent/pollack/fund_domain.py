##  Code to create the Manin Relations class, which solves the 
##  "Manin relations".  That is, a description of Div^0(P^1(Q))
##  as a Z[Gamma_0(N)]-module in terms of generators and relations
##  is found.  The method used is geometric, constructing a nice
##  fundamental domain for Gamma_0(N) and reading the relevant Manin
##  relations off of that picture.  The algorithm follows the paper 
##  of Pollack and Stevens "Overconvergent modular symbols and p-adic 
##  L-functions"
